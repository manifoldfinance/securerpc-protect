# Introducing SecureRPC Privacy Features

Posted on January 3, 2025 by SecureRPC Team

We're excited to announce the launch of our comprehensive privacy features suite, designed to protect your transactions and maintain anonymity on the Ethereum network.

## Key Features

### 1. MEV Protection

Our MEV protection system ensures that your transactions are safe from front-running and sandwich attacks. By utilizing a private transaction pool and sophisticated routing algorithms, we minimize the risk of value extraction.

### 2. Private Transaction Pool

Transactions submitted through SecureRPC are held in a private pool before being broadcast to the network. This prevents others from viewing and potentially exploiting your pending transactions.

### 3. Flashbots Integration

We've integrated directly with Flashbots to provide additional protection and optimal transaction ordering. This helps ensure your transactions are included in blocks efficiently and safely.

### 4. Transaction Privacy

Our infrastructure includes several privacy-enhancing features:

- Transaction obfuscation
- Distributed submission
- Timing randomization
- Network privacy

## Getting Started

To start using these privacy features, simply include the appropriate headers in your RPC requests:

```javascript
const web3 = new Web3('https://api.securerpc.com/v1');
web3.setRequestHeader('X-Privacy-Level', 'maximum');

// Your transaction will now use all privacy features
const tx = await web3.eth.sendTransaction({...});
